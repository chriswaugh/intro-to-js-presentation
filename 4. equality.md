# Equality

You'll have written code like this

```
if (1 == 1) true // true
```

Or to simplify for demo...

```
1 == 1 // true
1 == 2 // false
```

**Now lets dig deeper...**

```
1 == '1' // true
[] == 0  // true
'' == 0  // true
```

## What's happening

What you've just seen is a few examples of loose equality and type conversion.

Lets start back at the beginning:

```1 == '1' // true```

We're happy `1 == 1`, but why does `1 == '1'`?

This is where the magic happens. We have two different data types being compared.

Most other languages may just say they're fundamentally different and return false. *Javascript is not like most other languages!*

I won't go too much under the hood, but what effectively happens is JS will look at the types on both sides and try to make them the same so it can compare like-for-like. [The heirarchy of how these comparisons and conversions are done is on the MDN and I'd recommend you look at it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness), but crucially numbers take precidence over strings so the string will be converted to a number for comparison.

Effectively this kind of thing happens behind the scenes:

```Number('1') // 1```

We now have two number ones which are the same, so all is well and the match is made.

**So why does an empty array equal zero - or an empty string?**

Same thing.

```
Number([]) // 0
Number('') // 0
```

## How to get around the problem

The main takeaway I can give you from this whole presentation...

**Use strict equality. Always.**

Lets look at all of our examples again, this time we'll use strict equality:

```
1 === 1   // true
1 === '1' // false
[] === 0  // false
'' === 0  // false
```

## One last thing

Problem solved! Oh, except for one last thing... have you ever tried to parse a user input into a number? You may know the pain:

```
var n = parseInt('n') // NaN

// or

var n = Math.sqrt(-1) // NaN

// ---

n === NaN // false
n == NaN  // false
n == n    // false
```

`NaN` is not equal to anything ever! It's the only thing that behaves this way. Fortunately you can determine a `NaN` if you need to:

```isNaN(n) // true```
