# What is a prototype language

Javascript *is* object oriented. But not in the way you're used to.

Rather than having a class based inheritance model, it uses a prototypal inheritance model.

**Important to note** - *because it's confusing!* - classes were added to JS as part of ECMAScript 2015, but they are just syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance and they don't add a new classic OO-style inheritance model.

We'll cover some key parts of how this works but I'd strongly recommend reading further to fully understand it. Fortunately there are some great resources online.

**Further reading**

There are some great videos on how prototypes work at [Fun fun function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q), most of this section comes from those videos.

There is also some brilliant documentation on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)

## Prototypal inheritance!?

Lets explain by example.

First, lets create a food object using an object literal:

```
var food = {
	init: function(type) {
		this.type = type
	}
	eat: function() {
		return "you ate the " + type;
	}
}
```

We can now use it:

```
food.init("sausage")
food.eat() // you ate the sausage
```

Of course you may want to have more than one type of food in your application. So we can do this:

```
var bacon = Object.create(food)
bacon.init("bacon")
bacon.eat() // you ate the bacon 

var egg = Object.create(food)
egg.init("egg")
egg.eat() // you ate the egg
```

Looking at this you might infer that `Object.create` creates a copy of the object. Lets see if it's true (replace the last example with this):

```
var bacon = Object.create(food)
var egg = Object.create(food)

food.eat = function() {
	return "i ate the " + this.type;
}

bacon.init("bacon")
bacon.eat() // i ate the bacon 

egg.init("egg")
egg.eat() // i ate the egg
```

This is because `Object.create` doesn't create a copy of the food object. It creates a new empty object and assigns food as being the prototype of that object.

`bacon` and `egg` don't have their own `eat()` method, they inherit it from `food`. For those familiar with classic inheritance this should make sense so far, although the ability to redefine things at runtime may be a little foreign!

Now lets replace the above with:

```
var bacon = Object.create(food)

bacon.init("bacon")
bacon.eat() // you ate the bacon
food.type = "hash brown"
bacon.eat() // you ate the bacon
```

So as part of `init()`, the `type` property in `bacon` is set to `this` - so it exists within bacon and changing it in the prototype makes no difference.

However if bacon didn't have a type...

```
var bacon = Object.create(food)

//bacon.init("bacon")
bacon.eat() // you ate the undefined
food.type = "hash brown"
bacon.eat() // you ate the hash brown
```

This is an example of the prototype chain in action.

In the first example, bacon looks for the type property on itself and doesnt find anything, it then looks in its prototype and finds nothing too.

In the second example it finds hash brown in the prototype and returns that.

You can also use this for type checking:

```
food.isPrototypeOf(bacon) // true
food.isPrototypeOf(egg)   // true
food.isPrototypeOf(12345) // false
```

It's all very similar to OO inheritance, but the key difference here is that the prototype chain has objects inheriting from other objects, there are no classes.

You'll rarely see code like the above in the wild, however. The most common way you'd see this kind of thing done is like this:

```
function Person(greeting) {
	this.greeting = greeting
}

Person.prototype.talk = function() {
	return "I say " + this.greeting
}

var chris = new Person("Hello!")
chris.talk() // Hello!
```

This is how **lots and lots and lots** of JS is written. When you know to look for it you'll see it a lot! And more to the point, it's how the new `class` keyword in ECMAScript works under the hood so is definitely nice to know.

**How does that work / what does `new` do!?**

That's a good question. [Have a watch of this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3zzCY62NYc)

## Monkey patching

**Monkey patching - fun, but don't do it!**

Monkey patching is altering a program's behaviour at runtime.

As we've seen we can change things in the prototype chain at run time (as we changed `food` in the above example).

Having the ability to do this opens up some really interesting possibilities:

```
var double = function(i) { return i * 2; }
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [10, 20, 30];

Array.prototype.double = function() {
	return this.map(double);
}

// works on existing instances that are already defined
array1.double()
array2.double()

// also works on all future instances too!
[50, 2, 30].double()
```

You can do this on basically anything and as a result end up with some really nice expressive code...

```
Number.prototype.times = function(f) {
  for (var i = 0; i < this; i++) {
    f();
  }
}

10..times(function() {
  console.log('hello!')
});
```

**This is why you don't do it...**

If you add features to, or change features of, common objects you can end up with things behaving in ways that you wouldn't naturally expect and in ways that may conflict with other libraries and code in your project.

For example, the `underscore` library created a nice functional way to map arrays before it was a native feature.

Rather than by adding `map` to the array prototype then instead made it so that you mapped via `_.map(array, function)`.

`map` then became a native feature of arrays and *nothing broke*.

The opposite of this was the `prototype` library which used to - years ago - augment basic DOM objects and as a result things *did* break!

**That said**

It works really well for stubbing/mocking!
