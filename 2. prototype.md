# What is a prototype language

Javascript *is* object oriented. But not in the way you're used to.

Rather than having a class based inheritance model, it uses a prototypal inheritance model.

**Important to note** - *because it's confusing!* - classes were added to JS as part of ECMAScript 2015, but they are just syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance and they don't add a new classic OO-style inheritance model.

We'll cover some key parts of how this works but I'd strongly recommend reading further to fully understand it. Fortunately there are some great resources online.

**Further reading**

There are some great videos on how prototypes work at [Fun fun function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)

And some brilliant documentation on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)

## Prototypal inheritance!?

**---work in progress start---**

Currently thinking is to describe as per these two videos:

Explain simply with Object.create

Then do the more common one

Making key point of explaining the prototype chain. If nothing else that's the main thing worth knowing.

## Monkey patching

**Monkey patching - fun, but don't do it!**

Monkey patching is altering a program's behaviour at runtime.

Because we can add things onto the prototype chain whenever we please we can do some really interesting things:

```
var double = function(i) { return i * 2; }
var array1 = [1, 2, 3];
var array2 = [10, 20, 30];

Array.prototype.double = function() {
	return this.map(double);
}

// works on existing instances that are already defined
array1.double()
array2.double()

// also works on all future instances too!
[50, 2, 30].double()
```

You can do this on basically anything and as a result end up with some really nice expressive code...

```
Number.prototype.times = function(f) {
  for (var i = 0; i < this; i++) {
    f();
  }
}

10..times(function() {
  console.log('hello!')
});
```

**This is why you don't do it...**

If you add features to, or change features of, common objects you can end up with things behaving in ways that you wouldn't naturally expect and in ways that may conflict with other libraries and code in your project.

For example, the `underscore` library created a nice functional way to map arrays before it was a native feature.

Rather than by adding `map` to the array prototype then instead made it so that you mapped via `_.map(array, function)`.

`map` then became a native feature of arrays and *nothing broke*.

The opposite of this was the `prototype` library which used to - years ago - augment basic DOM objects and as a result things *did* break!

**That said**

It works really well for stubbing/mocking!

Now you can write awesome JS code lets look further into how best to structure it.
