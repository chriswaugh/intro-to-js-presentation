# Scoping

**Note: We're deliberately not going to cover `this` and bounding contexts - that requires more time than we have. We'll just cover some simple ideas...**

So I can create a function like this:

```
function animate() { return "animating!" }
```

But what happens if I include that on a web page and at some point in the future I include another js file which also has a function with the same name?

```
function animate() { return "i am animating!" }
```

Result - our `animate` method is overwritten

To get around this you could - and I've seen it done - get really verbose with your naming i.e. `animateTheNewsPageHeader()`, but there is a better way:

```
var myApplication = {}
myApplication.NewsPage = {}
myApplication.NewsPage.animate = function() {}
// etc

// to invoke...
myApplication.NewsPage.animate();
```

This isn't the only way to do it, and depending on context may not be the best, but it is perhaps one of the simplest ways.

In any case, as a result you end up with scoping which is much cleaner and you only exposing one object (`myApplication`) to the global scope.

## More complex

What about if my application held state and I didn't want it to be editable?

```
(function(global) {
  // we declare our variables inside the function,
  // keeping them private
  var score = 100
  var getScore = function() { return score; }
  var winPoint = function() { score++; }

  // we can then selectively expose some of them to
  // the outer scope
  global.getScore = getScore
  global.winPoint = winPoint
})(this)

this.getScore() // 100
this.winPoint()
this.getScore() // 101

// you can't edit score directly out here!
```

jQuery uses this approach in order to keep all its internal gubbins out of the global scope.

You can also use this approach so that your JS works both in the window scope (i.e. in a browser), and within JS applications.
