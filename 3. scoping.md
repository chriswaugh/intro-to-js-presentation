# Scoping

## Intro

**Note: We're deliberately not going to cover `this` and bounding contexts - that requires more time than we have. We'll just cover some simple ideas...**

So I can create a function like this:

```
function animate() { console.log("animating!"); }
```

But what happens if I include that on a web page and at some point in the future I include another js file which also has a function with the same name?

```
function animate() { console.log("i am animating!"); }
```

Result - our animation method is overwritten

To get around this you could - and I've seen it done - get really verbose with your naming i.e. `animateTheNewsPageHeader()`, but there is a better way:

```
var myApplication = {}
myApplication.NewsPage = {}
myApplication.NewsPage.animate = function() {}
// etc
```

This is much cleaner and you're only exposing one object to the global scope.

## More complex

What about if my application held state and I didn't want it to be editable?

```
(function(global) {
  var i = 100
  var getScore = function() { return i; }
  var winPoint = function() { i++; }
  
  global.getScore = getScore
  global.winPoint = winPoint
})(this)

getScore() // 100
winPoint()
getScore() // 101

```

jQuery uses this approach in order to keep all its internal gubbins out of the global scope.

You can also use this approach so that your JS works both in the window scope and within JS applications.

We've covered a lot of pretty complex stuff now, so we'll finish off by looking at some easy things! Next up - equality.
