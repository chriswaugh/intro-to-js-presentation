# Intro

## JS is loosely typed

```
var a = 1
a // 1
a = "squiggle"
a // squiggle
a = [1, "squiggle", [{greetings: "Hello"}], null]
// etc
```

## Functions are first class citizens

```
// functions can be assigned to variables
var double = function(i) { return i * 2 }
double(2) // 4

// you can use them as parameters in other functions
[1, 2, 3].map(function(i) { return i * 2 })

// and you can combine the above
[1, 2, 3].map(double) // [2, 4, 6]
```

This gives us a lot of power to write really expressive code.

So you can write functional style code in JS, can you write OO style code?

*Yes*, but there are some fundamental differences we need to cover first...
